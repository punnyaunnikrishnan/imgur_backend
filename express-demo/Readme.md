# Milestone-6: Imgur Backend

## Learning Competencies

At the end of this milestone you will learn

- Reading and understanding code
- Backend vs Frontend
- Building dynamic webapps using Express
- Understanding the databases: Mongodb

## Problem Statement:

Woohoo! Look like we're doing some real web app development now. Isn't this a lot more fun!? Working with actual pages and interactivity and users and profiles and databases and bugs and errors and crashes (OK! Maybe the last 3 aren't that fun).

An image hosting service allows individuals to upload images to an Internet website. The image host will then store the image onto its server, and show the individual different types of code to allow others to view that image.

For this Milestone, we will be creating only the Wireframes/Screens of how our app should like and the Backend APIs.

 IMGUR is the internet's most loved image hosting website because it lets you store as many photos as you like without having them deleted until you decide you want them gone. It's simple, easy to use, provides with various features and above all it's free. Also another beauty of the app is that it works as well without logging in or signing up. It has a massive user base with support for popular image formats and user comments. It's actually more of a central hub for storing and sharing photos than just a simple image hosting service. It is the place where youâ€™ll find the funniest, most informative and inspiring images, memes, GIFs, and visual stories served up in an endless stream of bite-sized fun. Powered by a passionate community of people from all around the world, anyone can join to share cool stuff and vote the best to the top.

In addition to storing your photos, Imgur lets you crop and resize pictures.
